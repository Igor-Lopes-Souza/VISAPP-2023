# Cardiac arrhythmia classification in electrocardiogram signals through Convolutional Neural Networks
# DATASET
The ECG heartbeat signals are obtained from the open-source Physio Bank MIT-BIH Arrhythmia database https://https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shayanfazeli/heartbeat.This database consists of a 48-half-hour long ECG recording from 47 subjects obtained with Lead II ECG signal. Each signal is sampled at 360Hz, and each ECG beat is 260 samples long. Furthermore, these recordings were interpreted and validated by at least two cardiologists. The database consists of annotations for both heartbeat class information and R-peak position information verified by two or more expert cardiologists. The 17 beat types can be classified into five beat classes defined by the AAMI which follows the American National Standard for Ambulatory ECGs (ANSI/AAMI EC38:2007) recommendations.
